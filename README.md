# Grimoire

**Grimoire** is a CLI framework designed to improve developer experience across tooling, testing, and code generation.

It helps teams build better CLIs, streamline workflows, and scaffold consistent developer tools — with metadata generation as a bonus.

## 🚀 What is Grimoire?

Grimoire is a modular CLI framework built for DX-first development.

It provides:

- 🧱 A foundation for building custom CLIs
- ⚙️ Utilities to scaffold, test, and document CLI tools
- 📦 Optional metadata generation in `.gen.{json,yaml,md}` formats

> Whether you're building internal tools or public-facing CLIs, Grimoire helps you do it faster and cleaner.
